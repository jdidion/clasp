Cell Line Authentication by SNP Profiling (CLASP).

This package supports the publication:

Didion JP et al, 'SNP array profiling of mouse cell lines identifies their strains 
    of origin and reveals cross-contamination and widespread 
    aneuploidy,' BMC Genomics 2014, 15:847, doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-847.

This package can be installed from CRAN. The vignette demonstrates how to use CLASP to reproduce the analyses from the paper. Because the vignette takes a very long time to run, it is not a part of the R package.
