\title{Create a sample set from a list of samples.}
\usage{
import.sample.set(name, db, description = NULL, samples = NULL,
  array.id = NULL, pedigree = NULL, fetch = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{A unique name for the sample set.}

\item{db}{the datbase connection.}

\item{description}{A text description of the sample set.}

\item{samples}{a vector of sample IDs, a data.frame as specified in \code{import.samples},
or a path to a file containing sample data.}

\item{array.id}{array ID to use for import.samples. Ignored unless samples is a data frame
or path.}

\item{pedigree}{Pedigree information as specified in \code{import.samples}.}

\item{fetch}{if \code{samples} is a vector of sample IDs, whether to fetch the sample information
from the database rather than the default, which is to just return the new sample set ID.}
}
\value{
sample set ID, or, if samples was a data frame, a list with the following elements:
1. set.id: The ID of the new sample set.
2. ids: A vector of ids for the samples that were imported.
3. ped: Pedigree data.frame, with sample names replaced with IDs.
}
\description{
A sample set is created. If samples is a vector of sample IDs, those samples are added to
the set. If it is a data frame, \code{import.samples} is called.
