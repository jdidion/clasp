\title{Copy number analysis using the genoCN package.
genoCN was designed for copy number analysis of human tumor genotypes. Therefore, it
assumes that the default state is copy number 2 and all three genotypes possible (AA/AB/BB).
This is state 1 in both the genoCNV and genoCNA HMM. For inbred strains, the default state
should actually be one of homozygosity (state 2).}
\usage{
copy.number.genoCN(samples, metrics, pfb, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{data.frame of sample info. At a minimum, name and type are required.}

\item{metrics}{list of data.frames (one per sample), each with copy number metrics (baf and lrr)
for each marker.}

\item{pfb}{data.frame with data from PennCNV PFB file (see notes).}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to .run.genoCNA.}
}
\value{
A list of genoCNAResult objects,
}
\description{
Short segments can be avoided by setting seg.nSNP to a larger number (default=3).
}
\details{
The PFB format originated with PennCNV and is also used in genoCNA. A file is derived for each array.
We provide PFBs for MUGA and MegaMUGA. A future version of the software will include a function to
derive your own PFB, but for the time being please contact the author for help adpating this software
to a new array. A PFB has three columns: Chr, Position, PFB, with rownames being marker IDs.
