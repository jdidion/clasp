\title{Import sample data.}
\usage{
import.samples(samples, array.id, db, pedigree = NULL, fetch = FALSE,
  start.transaction = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{path to file, data.frame containing sample information, or vector of sample IDs.}

\item{array.id}{ID of the array.}

\item{db}{the database connection.}

\item{pedigree}{pedigree information for samples with known parentage, or NULL.}

\item{fetch}{if \code{samples} us a list of IDs, whether to fetch sample information.}

\item{start.transaction}{whether to start a database transaction. Should only be set to FALSE
when called from another function that itself starts a transaction.}
}
\value{
a list with two elements:
1. ids: a vector of database IDs, one for each sample.
2. ped: the pedigree matrix with sample names replaced by ids (or NULL if no pedigree was specified).
}
\description{
The samples and pedigree parameters can be specified as a single or two separate
data.frames or files. If they are specfied as files, than blank fields in logical
columns will be given the default value of FALSE.
}
\details{
\code{samples} must be a data.frame with eight columns:
1. name: Sample name.
2. cell_line: Name of the cell line, or blank if this is a non-cell line sample.
3. background: Genetic background information, e.g. name of mouse inbred strain.
4. type: sample type (inbred, outbred, F1, wild); see note.
5. taxon: The sample taxon, as precise as possible.
6. source: Person/lab/institution that provided the sample.
7. description: Text description of the sample.
8. impute: boolean, whether the sample should be used for imputation
of synthetic F1s.

\code{pedigree} must be a data.frame with three columns: name, mother, father. These must all
uniquely refer to a sample within the \code{samples} data frame.

If \code{samples} is a path, then pedigree can be specified as an additional three columns.

Samples must be coded as being of one of four types:
1. inbred: fully inbred mouse strain with little to no variablility between the animals of
that strain.
2. outbred: outbred stock; individuals share a common background but are randomly mated such
that there is a large degree of variability between individuals.
3. F1: a cross between two distinct parental strains/individuals. Pedigree information should be
provided if the parental strains are also among the samples.
4. wild: wild-caught individual; generally does not exhibit high identity with any other strain
in the database.
