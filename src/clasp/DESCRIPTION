Title: Cell Line Authentication by SNP Profiling
Version: 0.1
Authors: "John Didion <johndidion@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: CLASP uses SNP array data to determine whether a
    cell line matches its expected genetic background and predicts
    whether it is contaminated and/or aneuploid. If you use this
    software in a publication, please cite: Didion JP et al, 'SNP 
    array profiling of mouse cell lines identifies their strains 
    of origin and reveals cross-contamination and widespread 
    aneuploidy,' BMC Genomics 2014, 15:847, doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-847.
